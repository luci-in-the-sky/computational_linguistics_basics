# Bayes' rule
## example : 25% of the positive tweets contain the word ‘happy’.  
## => given positive, happy probability is 25%
## => p(happy|positive) = 25%
## => p(happy|positive) = (p(happy) / p(positive))* p(positive|happy)
## => p(x|y) = (p(x) / p(y)) * p(y|x)

## called naïve because it assumes all your features are independent
